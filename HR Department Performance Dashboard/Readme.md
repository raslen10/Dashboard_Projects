# HR Department Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the HR department's performance using data visualization and interactive dashboards. The dashboard is designed to monitor key HR metrics, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into employee demographics, skills, performance ratings, leave tracking, and salary distribution.

## Key Features

- **Employee Demographics**: Analyze the gender distribution, age range, and employment status of employees.
- **Skills Breakdown**: Visualize the distribution of key skills across the workforce.
- **Performance Rating**: Track the average performance rating of employees.
- **Leave Tracking**: Monitor leave patterns by job title.
- **Salary Analysis**: Examine salary distribution by job title.
- **Regional Distribution**: Understand the geographical distribution of employees.
- **Work Location**: Analyze the distribution of employees working in the branch office, head office, or remotely.

## Data Source

The project utilizes an Excel file (`data.xls`) containing employee data. This data includes information on employee demographics, skills, performance ratings, leave records, and salaries.

## Data Processing

The raw data in `data.xls` has been processed and transformed using pivot tables to summarize and aggregate relevant information. These pivot tables serve as the data source for the interactive dashboard.

## Dashboard

The interactive dashboard (represented by `dash.png`) provides a user-friendly interface to explore the HR data. It includes various charts and graphs, such as:

- Bar charts for skills breakdown and leave tracking.
- Pie charts for gender distribution and employment status.
- Column charts for age range and salary distribution.
- Tables for regional distribution.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) like average performance rating.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data processing and pivot tables.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Used to create the dashboard. (Note: Details of the specific tool used are not visible on the provided image, but it appears to be a Power BI dashboard.)

## How to Use

1. Open the `data.xls` file to explore the raw data and pivot tables.
2. Refer to the `dash.png` image to understand the layout and visualizations of the dashboard.
3. Use the dashboard to analyze and monitor the HR department's performance.

## Note

This project is a simplified representation of an HR department performance dashboard. It can be further enhanced by incorporating additional data sources, advanced analytics, and interactive features.
