# Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau

## Overview
In this Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau project, we tackle a real-world case to optimize a website’s newsfeed feature for maximum user engagement. We delve into a real-life database, perform data analysis in Tableau, and unearth crucial insights that enhance professional portfolios and skillsets.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to generate graphs that analyze users’ interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service. Our goal is to create a data visualization in Tableau that captures critical findings from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023. This Tableau dashboard helps deduce necessary conclusions and recommend potential refinements.

## Challenge
A newsfeed is a part of a website that constantly updates with new content, showcasing the latest news or activities. This feature facilitates real-time discoveries and encourages user engagement by presenting fresh content each time the user accesses the platform. The 365 platform’s Newsfeed offers a mix of automated and manual posts. Automated entries showcase students’ milestones, such as completing an award card collection or earning a certificate of achievement, while manual entries are texts created by students to share insights or opinions with the community.

## Aim
The aim of this Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau project is to determine which type of post resonates more with our audience and identify potential issues with these features, along with suggestions for enhancements. We aim to create several visualizations providing crucial information about the newsfeed and how the users react to it.

## Strategy
Drawing from the findings, we create a strategy to optimize the newsfeed service, ensuring it’s engaging and encourages prolonged platform usage. This fosters a vibrant online community and, ultimately, influences course subscriptions and renewals.

## Project Requirements
- Tableau Public 2023.1 or newer

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- Identified which types of posts resonate more with users.
- Suggested enhancements to the newsfeed feature based on user engagement patterns.
